## Motivation ðŸ’­
Spotify removed its feature to see and share lyrics from its free tier just to bring it back again. 
So, I made this app to get and store lyrics for my favorite songs from Genius and share them like Spotify,
all in Material 3 look. As an audiophile, This has now become my way to listen to complete albums with lyrics without 
dealing with genius's "UI".
