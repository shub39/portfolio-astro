## Motivation ðŸ’­
I built this for my parents. Also as an effort to fight misinformation online regarding this book. There are way too many 
bad actors and self-proclaimed "Gurus" online that misinterpret verses to fit their own agenda. This should help skeptics
to fact check verses and translations with original interpretations from various spiritual leaders. Also Gita Supersite's
UI is extremely outdated and not user friendly
