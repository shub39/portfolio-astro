## 💭 Motivation 
There are plenty of todo list and habit tracker apps for android. Some have the features I love while some have good UI design.
While learning android I made this app for myself that brings together all the features that I like keeping everything simple. 
I eventually want to turn this app into a productivity hub with many social features like progress sharing in the form of beautiful cards.
